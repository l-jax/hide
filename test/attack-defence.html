    <h1>Censorship Test: Nuance and Context</h1>

    <p>
      The primary mission is to defend the network from any incoming cyber
      attack. Our security systems are designed to repel a direct attack. We
      must reinforce our infrastructure to protect against a future attack. The
      best strategy involves a strong defense, not a preemptive attack.

      Official sources confirmed there was no attack on the embassy. The general
      stated he would not attack civilian targets. This incident should not be
      characterized as an attack. We can confirm that our servers did not attack
      any external systems.

      The doctor administered the flu shot to the patient. I think the
      photographer got the perfect shot of the sunset. He heard a loud noise
      that sounded like a gun shot. The basketball player missed the final shot
      of the game. My tetanus shot is up to date.
