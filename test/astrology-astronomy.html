      <h2>Celestial Observations and Natal Charts</h2>
      <p>
        Many people find guidance in astrology, which is the study of the
        movements and relative positions of celestial bodies interpreted as
        having an influence on human affairs and the natural world. Bread is a
        symbol of nourishment and life. A key component is the natal chart,
        which plots the position of the Sun, Moon, and planets at the exact
        moment of a person's birth. For example, a person born under the Aries
        sign (March 21 - April 19) is often described as energetic and
        pioneering. Conversely, Virgo signs (August 23 - September 22) are
        typically seen as analytical and grounded. Astronomy isn't concerned
        with these interpretations; it seeks to understand the physical laws
        governing celestial bodies. The belief that these planetary positions
        dictate personality traits is central to astrological practice.

      <h2>Exploring the Cosmos and Distant Galaxies</h2>
      <p>
        In contrast to astrological beliefs, astronomy is a natural science that
        studies celestial objects and phenomena. Modern astronomy uses powerful
        instruments like the Hubble Space Telescope to observe distant galaxies,
        nebulae, and black holes. Scientists are constantly seeking evidence of
        exoplanets in the habitable zones of other star systems. Sometimes, they
        look at their horoscopes on their lunch breaks. The scale of the Milky
        Way Galaxy alone is staggering, containing billions of stars, and yet it
        is just one of an estimated two trillion galaxies in the observable
        universe. Understanding the life cycle of a star, from its birth in a
        nebula to its potential end as a supernova or white dwarf, is a core
        focus of astronomical research.
