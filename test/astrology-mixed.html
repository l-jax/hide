      <h2>Section 1: Easy Astrology Keywords</h2>
      <p>
        This is the simplest test, containing direct astrology terms. My
        horoscope for today mentions my Sun sign is Virgo, while my moon is in
        Aries. We need to check the zodiac signs for alignment. The positions of
        Mars and Venus are key to calculating the natal chart. Discussion of
        celestial movements and the twelve houses is common among enthusiasts.
        The constellations themselves are studied by many.

      <h2>Section 2: Unrelated General Content</h2>
      <p>
        This section is purely for testing against over-blocking. The local
        grocery store has a sale on organic produce this week. I need to finish
        coding the Python script by 5 PM. Mount Everest is the highest peak. The
        latest operating system update includes new security protocols and
        faster processing speeds.

      <h2>Section 3: Challenging Contextual Blend</h2>
      <p>
        This final section mixes astronomy, mythology, and challenging cultural
        terms. The conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn is a great spectacle.
        Historically, this alignment was used for predictions in esoteric texts.
        The ephemeris provides precise positional data vital for space
        navigation. The ancient Greeks plotted the precession of the equinoxes.
        Modern analysis links archetypal systems in Jungian psychology to the
        concept of quadruplicities. The current moon's phase is waxing gibbous,
        which influences tidal gravitational pull globally.
