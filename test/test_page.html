        The **bank** of the river was eroding quickly. Fishermen, concerned
        about the stability of the shore, decided to visit the local **bank**
        branch to apply for a small business loan, hoping to **bank** the small
        profit from their recent catch. Peter, knowing little about finance,
        also remembered his laptop's data **bank** was full. He wished he had
        time to browse the latest **fashionable** clothes, but worried about
        navigating the **financial** terminology. He only hoped he wouldn't
        stumble over his words or accidentally mention the recent
        <span style="text-decoration: underline">fishing</span> fiasco.

        The military **strike** team prepared for their operation, carefully
        reviewing the mission parameters. Meanwhile, across the city, unionized
        factory workers initiated a labor **strike** at midnight. The lead
        organizer, advocating instead for **total peace** and **cooperation**
        with management, was keen to avoid any **violent** confrontation during
        the protest. Her belief in **non-aggression** was key to her success.
        She had a strong sense of **pride** in her organizational skills, which
        she hoped would prevent chaos.

        A young child's favorite toy was a small wooden **block** shaped like a
        **star**. She used it to build elaborate, imaginary spacecraft. The
        child, who truly was a **chip off the old block**, inherited her
        father's knack for building things. Her older brother was more
        interested in the colossal, gaseous **stars** light-years away, trying
        to memorize the coordinates of a specific **red** dwarf for school.
        Noticing a small stain on the carpet, their mother quickly pointed to
        the **red** spill. She asked her brother to **block** the doorway with a
        towel before he started building a cushion **blockade** to protect the
        floor.
